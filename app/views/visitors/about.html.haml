      %p.text-justify dokspot is a digital instruction management platform that innovates the way instructions are delivered to customers. We focus on the medical device industry.
      %p.text-justify The current model for delivering medical device instructions to customers is outdated and highly inefficient. The cost of instructions can account for up to 5% of total product cost, harms the environment and provides little benefit to the customer.
      %p.text-justify Our team is a fusion of medical device industry experts and software developers. This enables us to have a deep understanding of our client requirements and provide the innovative solutions and technologies needed to increase our clients efficiency and customer focus in communication of instructions.
      %p.text-justify dokspot is headquartered and registered in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
